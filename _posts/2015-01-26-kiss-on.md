title: KISS On! A new IR Cab Pack appears from Clark Kent!
---

I beta test snazzy, high end guitar gear for [Fractal Audio](http://www.fractalaudio.com/) and one of the occassional perks is we get early access to third party IR packs. This week we got Mikko Hypponen's ([Clark Kent](http://forum.fractalaudio.com/members/clark-kent.html) on the Fractal Forum) new Marshall Brit TV cab pack preview and I've got to say: I'm love. These IRs have the mid-range teeth that I love. Bite-y and snarly and all kinds of aggressive. I'm not sure what the final pack will look like in terms of IRs yet, but there were a ton of just excellent ones in the beta we got.

Check it out:

That's rock 'n' roll for sure.
