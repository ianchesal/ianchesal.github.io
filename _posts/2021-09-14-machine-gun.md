Factory preset `106 - Machine Gun` from the latest Axe-Fx III factory preset pack does some amazing Hendrix tones. These were recorded with my McCarty 594 semi-hollow, bridge pickup with the coils tapped for single coil goodness.

### Scene 1: Polite

### Scene 2: Fuzz Vibe

But I turned off the phaser block.

### Scene 4: Octa Vibe

First with the phaser off:

Delicious.
