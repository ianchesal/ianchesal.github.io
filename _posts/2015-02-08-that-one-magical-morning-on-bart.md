title: That one magical morning on BART...
---

I ride BART every day. I get on in the mornings at the second stop on the line. In spite of being so close to the start of the line, it's always _very_ full. BART likes to brag that it "[runs more of its fleet than any other major transit agency despite having the oldest trains in the nation](http://sfbay.ca/2015/01/29/long-wait-expected-for-longer-bart-trains/)" but we all know that's marketeer-speak for "we're running at full capacity all the time with no room for growth or error". Right? Right.

This is what a "light" morning looks like at my stop, [Union City Station](http://www.bart.gov/stations/ucty), when I get on around 8:10 am:

Not bad; not great. You're at least confident you'll get a spot to stand and a place to hold on to. Some mornings you can score a place to lean (I was leaning against a door at the end of the train when I took this picture). And at least one morning a week I'll score a seat (though it usually ends up being given up mid-ride to someone older than me).

So imagine my surprise when I get to the platform and there's a train there, waiting, doors open and _no one is getting on the train_. What is this madness? The signs on the platform were all saying `Train will not stop` but the train conductor was on the PA saying it was an error. It was an [SFIA](http://www.bart.gov/stations/sfia)-bound train. My train. And indeed it was _my train_:

That train stayed nearly empty the entire way in to the city. Everyone who got on at each stop got a seat. No one sat in the seat next to me or directly across from me. It even _smelled_ decent, freshly cleaned. It was a beautiful thing and a glimpse of what BART was originally intended to be: [transportation of the future](http://blog.sfgate.com/parenting/2011/05/19/the-birth-of-bart-photos-from-the-1960s-and-70s/).

I'll remember my magical morning ride fondly.
