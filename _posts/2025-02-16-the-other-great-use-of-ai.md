title: The Other Great Use of AI?

No doubt, generative AI is changing the face of speculative family
conversations around coffee on a lazy, snowy Sunday morning. It has in our
house. I've been encouraging the family to learn how to apply generative AI
when doing research

Always on the lookout for real world examples and learning opportunities, we
were having a lazy, Sunday morning chat when a very deep question was posed by
the 10-year old. What an excellent time to demonstrate the true power of AI for
doing deep research!

With very little effort we had a high confidence answer to her question!

Related, I really like what [Perplexity](https://perplexity.ai) is doing and
I've been encouraging the family to learn how to apply it to doing research and
getting answers to questions. Providing the citations for the work it's doing
to generate its responses is incredibly helpful and goes a long way towards
allowing you to vet the answers it's giving you for correctness and
truthfulness.

As I mentioned yesterday, I think being good with AI tools is fast emerging as
a necessary skill and one that will separate the truly efficient and effective
from the merely okay.
