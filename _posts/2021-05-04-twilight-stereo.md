The inimitable and golden-ear'ed [burgs](https://forum.fractalaudio.com/members/burgs.31425/) on the Fractal forum made a post a while back about an amp from Magnatone that did this cool stereo phase thing. Hard to explain, go listen to his demo video of the amp to understand.

Today [he posted a preset for the Axe-Fx III](https://forum.fractalaudio.com/threads/stereo-harmonic-tremolo.150876/page-2#post-2086983) that trys to capture some of that beautiful, phasery, stereo goodness and darn if it isn't just the most sublime preset ever to play with my Silver Sky.

I tweaked his preset a bit. I opted to use a Harmonic Tremolo in place of the Uni-Vibe effect he had in the preset for the phasery sound. I thought it got closer to the sound of the Magnatone he demo'ed in his video and doesn't feel as deep and chewy and overpowering as the Uni-Vibe does.

Here's how I have the Harmonic Tremolo set up:

I have the bypass mode on the Phaser block set to `Mute Out` so I don't pass signal through the block when it's bypassed. I also set the mix on that block to 100% wet so it works well when the block is enabled and the Pan/Trem block above it is bypassed.

It's super fun to play.

He's got that JTM45 dialed in to _perfection_ there.

There's also a nice super-clean Archon model in there that's insipiring. I did a little live looping clip using that amp and my Silver Sky, again. A melody and chord change you might recognize.

That Archon clean rings like a beautiful bell, doesn't it? Very inspiring tones and a ton of fun to play this in stereo.
