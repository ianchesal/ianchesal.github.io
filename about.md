I am an engineering manager at [Stripe](https://stripe.com/jobs). I build developer environments, CI systems, data centers and highways to the cloud.

I like music. All kinds of music.

I beta test snazzy music-making gear for [Fractal Audio](http://www.fractalaudio.com/) and occassionally get together with far more talented musicians than myself to make some of it in public.

I'm a moderator at [Ask Different](https://apple.stackexchange.com/) -- the Stack Exchange Q&A site for all things Apple.
