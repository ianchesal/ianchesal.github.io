I'm currently an engineering manager at [Square](https://squareup.com/careers) working to improve developer environments and continuous integration infrastructure.

I like music. All kinds of music.

I beta test snazzy music-making gear for [Fractal Audio](http://www.fractalaudio.com/) and occassionally get together with far-more talented musicians to make some of it in public.

I'm a moderator at [Ask Different](https://apple.stackexchange.com/) -- the Stack Exchange Q&A site for all things Apple.
