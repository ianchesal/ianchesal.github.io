I build developer environments, CI systems, data centers and highways to the cloud. I am currently an engineering manager at [Marqeta](https://marqeta.com/). But I've also managed engineers at [Stripe](https://stripe.com), [Square](https://squareup.com) and [Altera](https://altera.com).

I like music. _All kinds of music._

I beta test snazzy music-making gear for [Fractal Audio](http://www.fractalaudio.com/) and occassionally get together with far more talented musicians than myself to make some of it in public.
